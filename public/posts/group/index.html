<main><p>In this first part, we will simply define what a group is. Before we can understand what a group is, we need to look at some other concepts.
We will build our intuition from each of the concepts we learn one by one.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-set">What is a Set?</h2>
<p>A <strong>set</strong> is a collection of unique thing. We will call each thing in a set an <strong>element</strong> of that set from now on.
We can have as many elements in a set as we want.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>O is a set of otters with 3 distinct otters named o1, o2, and o3. Each otter is an element of O.</p>
<p>We can denote it like this: O = {o1, o2, o3}.</p>
<p>This set O is <strong>finite</strong>. We can count how many otters we have, it&rsquo;s 3!</p>
<p>\( \mathbb{N} \) is a set of all counting numbers starting from 1.</p>
<p>We can denote it like this: \( \mathbb{N} \) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &hellip;}</p>
<p>This set \( \mathbb{N} \) is <strong>infinite</strong>. We can count how many numbers we have, but it will take forever to reach the last number!
Will we even reach the last number?</p>
<p>We can use membership to denote if an element is in a set.</p>
<p>\( o1 \in O \) means o1 is an element of O.</p>
<p>\( o4 \not\in O \) means o4 is NOT an element of O.</p>
<p>This is all we need to know about sets. Hopefully, we are still on the same page.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-an-operation">What is an Operation?</h2>
<p>An <strong>operation</strong> is simply a rule performed on an element or elements in a set. It tells us how many elements we take into the operation and return another element that may or may not be in the set.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take the set \( \mathbb{N} \) again.
We can denote an operation called negate, with symbol &ldquo;-&rdquo; that takes in one element of \( \mathbb{N} \) and returns the negative of that element.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p>\( 5 \in \mathbb{N} \) and -(5) = -5</p>
<p>Note that the element \( -5 \not\in \mathbb{N} \) so this operation does not ensure our result with be in the set \( \mathbb{N} \) we defined it on.</p>
<p>A <strong>binary operation</strong> is a specific type of operation that takes in exactly 2 elements in a set S and return another element that may or may not be in S.</p>
<p>An example of a binary operation is subtraction, which we could also denote with symbol &ldquo;-&rdquo;.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p>\( 3 \in \mathbb{N}, 2 \in \mathbb{N} \) and 3 - 2 = \( 1 \in \mathbb{N} \)</p>
<p>Question: Does this mean that the operation &ldquo;-&rdquo; will always return a result that is in \( \mathbb{N} \)?</p>
<p>Answer: No, of course not!</p>
<p>\( 3 \in \mathbb{N}, 2 \in \mathbb{N} \) and 2 - 3 = \( -1 \not\in \mathbb{N} \)</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-magma">What is a Magma?</h2>
<p><strong>Closure</strong> is a property of an operation.
In fact, when we talked about operations, we have already alluded on what closure could mean.
An operation defined on set S is closed if the result of the operation always gives an element that is in S.</p>
<p>Question: Is &ldquo;-&rdquo; defined on 1 input and 2 inputs closed?</p>
<p>Answer: Neither of them are closed, we already discussed why!</p>
<p>A <strong>magma</strong> is a set S with a closed binary operation.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider the set T = {TRUE, FALSE} and an operation XOR.
XOR is defined so that the result is TRUE if only 1 of the inputs is TRUE, and FALSE otherwise.</p>
<p>In other words,</p>
<p>FALSE XOR FALSE = FALSE</p>
<p>FALSE XOR TRUE = TRUE</p>
<p>TRUE XOR FALSE = TRUE</p>
<p>TRUE XOR TRUE = FALSE</p>
<p>Question: Is set T with the operation XOR a magma?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, because we tried every possible combinations of input, and all of them result in either TRUE or FALSE, which are elements of set T!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-semigroup">What is a Semigroup?</h2>
<p>An operation &ldquo;\( \circ \)&rdquo; is said to be <strong>associative</strong> in set S if it satisfies the following condition:</p>
<p>$$
a \circ (b \circ c) = (a \circ b) \circ c  = a \circ b \circ c = \qquad a, b, c \in S
$$</p>
<p>This seems like an inoffensive statement, but having this constraint holds a lot of weight.
Essentially we are able to group the parenthesis around our binary operation in many ways, and removing the parenthesis should not affect the outcome at all.</p>
<p>We can of course try to extend this to more than 3 elements. For example, with 4 elements in S:</p>
<p>$$
a \circ b \circ c \circ d
$$</p>
<p>We can group the parenthesis in the following ways:</p>
<p>(1) \( ((a \circ b) \circ c) \circ d \)</p>
<p>(2) \( (a \circ (b \circ c)) \circ d \)</p>
<p>(3) \( a \circ ((b \circ c) \circ d) \)</p>
<p>(4) \( a \circ (b \circ (c \circ d)) \)</p>
<p>(5) \( (a \circ b) \circ (c \circ d) \)</p>
<p>Question: Knowing that our operation is associative, can we prove that all of the above are equivalent?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes! Here is the proof!</p>
<p>Focusing on (1) and (2), if we ignore the d for a moment, the first 3 terms look just like our definition of associativity.
Since \( a \circ (b \circ c) = (a \circ b) \circ c \), we know that operating both on d will give the same outcome, so (1) = (2).</p>
<p>Focusing on (2) and (3), if we consider \( b \circ c \) as a single element, then we can also apply associativity on a, \( b \circ c \), d.
So, (2) = (3).</p>
<p>Focusing on (3) and (4), we can use the same logic as when we proved (1) = (2), but let a take the role that d took previously. This means (3) = (4).</p>
<p>Focusing on (4) and (5), we can treat \( c \circ d \) as a single element and use the same logic as when we proved (3) = (4). This means (4) = (5).</p>
<p>So, all of the five statements are equivalent. We just extended associativity to 4 elements, and we can keep doing this to as many elements as we want. This is a direct consequence of associativity.</p>
<p>Question: Is XOR defined previously associative in set T.</p>
<p>Answer: Yes! You can try it yourself case-by-case on 3 inputs! We brute force every possible outcomes!</p>
<p>A <strong>semigroup</strong> is a set S with a closed and associaitive binary operation.</p>
<p>Question: Is every magma a semigroup?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes!</p>
<p>Question: Is every semigroup a magma?</p>
<p>Answer: No! Only associative magmas are semigroups!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go through another example. We define a set of otters O with 2 elements, o1 and o2.
We also define an operator &ldquo;+&rdquo; in the following way:</p>
<p>o1 + o1 = o2</p>
<p>o1 + o2 = o2</p>
<p>o2 + o1 = o2</p>
<p>o2 + o2 = o1</p>
<p>If we apply an element with itself, we invert it by returning the other element.
Otherwise, we get the element o2.</p>
<p>Question: Is the set O = {o1, o2} with the operation &ldquo;+&rdquo; a semigroup?</p>
<p>Answer: No! We can give a counterexample!</p>
<p>(o1 + o1) + o2 = o2 + o2 = o1</p>
<p>o1 + (o1 + o2) = o1 + o2 = o2</p>
<p>So, \( (o1 + o1) + o2 \ne o1 + (o1 + o2) \), which means &ldquo;+&rdquo; in set O is not associative, so it does not form a semigroup.</p>
