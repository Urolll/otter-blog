        "tags": [],
        "content": "In this first part, we will simply define what a group is. Before we can understand what a group is, we need to look at some other concepts. We will build our intuition from each of the concepts we learn one by one. Lastly, I would like to give a couple examples of groups.\nWhat is a Set? A set is a collection of unique thing. We will call each thing in a set an element of that set from now on. We can have as many elements in a set as we want.\nFor example:\nO is a set of otters with 3 distinct otters named o1, o2, and o3. Each otter is an element of O.\nWe can denote it like this: O = {o1, o2, o3}.\nThis set O is finite. We can count how many otters we have, it\u0026rsquo;s 3!\n\\( \\mathbb{N} \\) is a set of all counting numbers starting from 1.\nWe can denote it like this: \\( \\mathbb{N} \\) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \u0026hellip;}\nThis set \\( \\mathbb{N} \\) is infinite. We can count how many numbers we have, but it will take forever to reach the last number! Will we even reach the last number?\nWe can use membership to denote if an element is in a set.\n\\( o1 \\in O \\) means o1 is an element of O.\n\\( o4 \\not\\in O \\) means o4 is NOT an element of O.\nThis is all we need to know about sets. Hopefully, we are still on the same page.\nWhat is an Operation? An operation is simply a rule performed on an element or elements in a set. It tells us how many elements we take into the operation and return another element that may or may not be in the set.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take the set \\( \\mathbb{N} \\) again. We can denote an operation called negate, with symbol \u0026ldquo;-\u0026rdquo; that takes in one element of \\( \\mathbb{N} \\) and returns the negative of that element.\nFor example,\n\\( 5 \\in \\mathbb{N} \\) and -(5) = -5\nNote that the element \\( -5 \\not\\in \\mathbb{N} \\) so this operation does not ensure our result with be in the set \\( \\mathbb{N} \\) we defined it on.\nA binary operation is a specific type of operation that takes in exactly 2 elements in a set S and return another element that may or may not be in S.\nAn example of a binary operation is subtraction, which we could also denote with symbol \u0026ldquo;-\u0026rdquo;.\nFor example,\n\\( 3 \\in \\mathbb{N}, 2 \\in \\mathbb{N} \\) and 3 - 2 = \\( 1 \\in \\mathbb{N} \\)\nQuestion: Does this mean that the operation \u0026ldquo;-\u0026rdquo; will always return a result that is in \\( \\mathbb{N} \\)?\nAnswer: No, of course not!\n\\( 3 \\in \\mathbb{N}, 2 \\in \\mathbb{N} \\) and 2 - 3 = \\( -1 \\not\\in \\mathbb{N} \\)\nWhat is a Magma? Closure is a property of an operation. In fact, when we talked about operations, we have already alluded on what closure could mean. An operation defined on set S is closed if the result of the operation always gives an element that is in S.\nQuestion: Is \u0026ldquo;-\u0026rdquo; defined on 1 input and 2 inputs closed?\nAnswer: Neither of them are closed, we already discussed why!\nA magma is a set S with a closed binary operation.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s consider the set T = {TRUE, FALSE} and an operation XOR. XOR is defined so that the result is TRUE if only 1 of the inputs is TRUE, and FALSE otherwise.\nIn other words,\nFALSE XOR FALSE = FALSE\nFALSE XOR TRUE = TRUE\nTRUE XOR FALSE = TRUE\nTRUE XOR TRUE = FALSE\nQuestion: Is set T with the operation XOR a magma?\nAnswer: Yes, because we tried every possible combinations of input, and all of them result in either TRUE or FALSE, which are elements of set T!\nWhat is a Semigroup? An operation \u0026ldquo;\\( \\circ \\)\u0026rdquo; is said to be associative in set S if it satisfies the following condition:\n$$ a \\circ (b \\circ c) = (a \\circ b) \\circ c = a \\circ b \\circ c = \\qquad a, b, c \\in S $$\nThis seems like an inoffensive statement, but having this constraint holds a lot of weight. Essentially we are able to group the parenthesis around our binary operation in many ways, and removing the parenthesis should not affect the outcome at all.\nWe can of course try to extend this to more than 3 elements. For example, with 4 elements in S:\n$$ a \\circ b \\circ c \\circ d $$\nWe can group the parenthesis in the following ways:\n(1) \\( ((a \\circ b) \\circ c) \\circ d \\)\n(2) \\( (a \\circ (b \\circ c)) \\circ d \\)\n(3) \\( a \\circ ((b \\circ c) \\circ d) \\)\n(4) \\( a \\circ (b \\circ (c \\circ d)) \\)\n(5) \\( (a \\circ b) \\circ (c \\circ d) \\)\nQuestion: Knowing that our operation is associative, can we prove that all of the above are equivalent?\nAnswer: Yes! Here is the proof!\nFocusing on (1) and (2), if we ignore the d for a moment, the first 3 terms look just like our definition of associativity. Since \\( a \\circ (b \\circ c) = (a \\circ b) \\circ c \\), we know that operating both on d will give the same outcome, so (1) = (2).\nFocusing on (2) and (3), if we consider \\( b \\circ c \\) as a single element, then we can also apply associativity on a, \\( b \\circ c \\), d. So, (2) = (3).\nFocusing on (3) and (4), we can use the same logic as when we proved (1) = (2), but let a take the role that d took previously. This means (3) = (4).\nFocusing on (4) and (5), we can treat \\( c \\circ d \\) as a single element and use the same logic as when we proved (3) = (4). This means (4) = (5).\nSo, all of the five statements are equivalent. We just extended associativity to 4 elements, and we can keep doing this to as many elements as we want. This is a direct consequence of associativity.\nQuestion: Is XOR defined previously associative in set T.\nAnswer: Yes! You can try it yourself case-by-case on 3 inputs! We brute force every possible outcomes!\nA semigroup is a set S with a closed and associaitive binary operation.\nQuestion: Is every magma a semigroup?\nAnswer: Yes!\nQuestion: Is every semigroup a magma?\nAnswer: No! Only associative magmas are semigroups!\nLet\u0026rsquo;s go through another example. We define a set of otters O with 2 elements, o1 and o2. We also define an operator \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; in the following way:\no1 + o1 = o2\no1 + o2 = o2\no2 + o1 = o2\no2 + o2 = o1\nIf we apply an element with itself, we invert it by returning the other element. Otherwise, we get the element o2.\nQuestion: Is the set O = {o1, o2} with the operation \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; a semigroup?\nAnswer: No! We can give a counterexample!\n(o1 + o1) + o2 = o2 + o2 = o1\no1 + (o1 + o2) = o1 + o2 = o2\nSo, \\( (o1 + o1) + o2 \\ne o1 + (o1 + o2) \\), which means \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; in set O is not associative, so it does not form a semigroup.\nWhat is a monoid? Some sets have a magical element inside of it. This element does something very cool. When you apply this element on anything in the set, either from the left or right, it magically gives back that other element. That element is called an identity, and we shall denote it with an \u0026ldquo;e\u0026rdquo;.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say we are in set S with operation \\( \\circ \\) and for all elements \\( a \\in S \\), \\( e \\circ a = a \\circ e = a \\). You guessed it, e is an identity and this is just a more formal way to define what we did previously.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget that \\( e \\in S \\) as well, so this includes the fact that \\( e \\circ e = e \\)\nQuestion: Does addition in \\( \\mathbb{N} \\) have an identity?\nAnswer: Yes, it\u0026rsquo;s the number 0!\nQuestion: Does multiplication in \\( \\mathbb{N} \\) have an identity?\nAnswer: Yes, it\u0026rsquo;s the number 1!\nLet \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) represent the integers. This includes all whole numbers that are positive, negative, and zero.\nQuestion: Does addition in \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) have an identity?\nAnswer: Yes, it\u0026rsquo;s the number 0!\nQuestion: Does multiplication in \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) have an identity?\nAnswer: Yes, it\u0026rsquo;s the number 1!\nQuestion: Can a set S have multiple identities?\nAnswer: No! This is not difficult to prove.\nWLOG, consider 2 identities \\( e_1, e_2 \\).\n\\( e_1 \\circ e_2 = e_2 \\) since \\( e_1 \\) is an identity.\nSimilarly, \\( e_1 \\circ e_2 = e_1 \\) since \\( e_2 \\) is also an identity.\nTherefore, \\( e_1 = e_2 \\), so they are the same element\nNow we can properly define a new algebraic structure. A monoid is a semigroup with an identity. In other words, it is a set S with a binary operation \\( \\circ \\) such that this operation is closed and associative, and S contains an identity element.\nSide note: If you have seen the infamous definition of a monad where \u0026ldquo;a monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors of some fixed category\u0026rdquo;. Then you at least know what a monoid is in that definition.\nWhat is a group? We have now reached the part we have been waiting for. What exactly is a group?\nBefore we can answer this question, there is another interesting property we should look at.\nConsider a set S with an operation \\( \\circ \\), and consider any element \\( a \\in S \\), is there an element x such that \\( a \\circ x = x \\circ a = e \\).\nIn other words, is there a magical element such that when applied to our selected element, gives us the identity e. Such an element is called an inverse.\nQuestion: Does every element in \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) have an inverse under addition?\nAnswer: Yes, for any \\( a \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\), the value -a is its inverse.\nQuestion: Does every element in \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) have an inverse under multiplication?\nAnswer: No, in fact, only the identity number \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo; has an inverse.\nIt is not difficult to guess what a group could possibly be. Indeed, a group is a monoid whose every element has an inverse. In other words, a set S with a binary operation \\( \\circ \\), where \\( \\circ \\) is closed and associative, with an identity element \\( e \\in S \\) and all elements in S have an inverse.\nLet \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) represent the set of all real numbers.\nQuestion: Is \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) under addition a group?\nAnswer: Yes!\nQuestion: Is \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) under multiplication a group?\nAnswer: Almost\u0026hellip;but no! The number 0 is the only number without an inverse, so not every element in \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) has a multiplicative inverse.\n",
